  content: This Capstone will collect, analyze and map historical language in newspapers,
    periodicals, legacy oral history recordings and archival collections describing
    immigrant communities in Washington and Oregon and visualize these trends in language
    and how they may have been influenced by specific commercial interests in the
    nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<br><br><br><br>· "1903 Prosperity Edition"

    headline: Purpose
    slug: pur
    content: The intention of this work is to bring both the industrial interests
      that influenced media representation, and the lived experience of the communities
      affected by that language down to a human scale. By analyzing these documents
      and noting how different communities were being represented depending on commercial
      interests, we can make new connections and understand the origins of seemingly
      constant cultural perceptions. <br><br>· This project serves primarily as a
      pedagogical tool and a methodology for analyzing historical material through
      increased access points through visual, audio, geospatial and text elements.
  col_2:
    headline: Relevance
    slug: rel
    content: Why does this matter? Why air out frequently offensive material from
      over 100 years ago? Just as the categorization of <em>Lesbian</em> and <em>Gay</em>
      topics under <em>Abnormal Psychology, Perversion and Derangement</em> in the
      Dewey Decimal System quietly stigmatized generations, I feel that this language
      may still influence our perceptions of ourselves and other communities, long
      past it's original intended use.<br><br>The lack of accountability in the dissemination
      of hate speech also has parallels with our current condition, where this language
      is now propelled and reflected digitally. Though technology leaders are quick
      to shrug and opine that "you can't put the genie back in the bottle," algorithms,
      and these collected works, have flesh and blood authors behind them, and those
      authors very often have commercial and economic interests behind their creations.

    headline: Background
    slug: bg
    content: The staying power of this language also has to do with the significance
      of this period in the Pacific Northwest. Our time frame begins ten years before
      the United States Census Bureau declared the closure of the western frontier.
      What follows feels like an ideological rather than physical land grab.

    content: A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>prominent theme throughout
      this research is the concept of "retaining" the American character in Washington
      and Oregon, when it was clearly roiling with development. A near constant theme
      in the collection are settlers gauging other immigrant groups on their ability
      to assimilate or "Americanize," with particular focus on differentiating between
      "New Immigrants" and "Old Immigrants," for groups that may have only arrived
      within ten years of one another.
  col_3:
    headline: ''
    slug: bg3
    content: During this period in American history, racial animosity was frequently
      used to divide labor, leading immigrant groups to undercut one another to the
      industrialist's advantage. Racial provocations would also be used as a straw
      man for industrialists to argue against anti-monopoly legislation, shape narratives
      around land development and act opportunistically during times of war.

    in historic materials, outdated and racist search terms needed to be utilized
    in the creation of this research. For example, in collecting articles for the
    Black community, searching "negro labor" within the parameters that were repeated
    for each community group (Washington and Oregon State publications, 1880-1930,
    sorted by relevance) yielded <strong>340</strong> results, as opposed to "colored
    labor" <strong>(165)</strong> and "black labor" <strong>(55)</strong>. That said,
    all of my descriptions for this community will use <strong>Black</strong>, drawing
    description guidance from the <em>Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia</em>.
