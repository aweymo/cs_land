  headline: "<strong>Introduction</strong>"
  content: This Capstone will collect, analyze and map historical language in newspapers,
    periodicals, legacy oral history recordings and archival collections describing
    immigrant communities in Washington and Oregon and visualize these trends in language
    and how they may have been influenced by specific commercial interests in the
    nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

    content: The intention of this work is to bring both the industrial interests
      that influenced media representation and the lived experience of the communities
      affected by that language down to a human scale. During this period in American
      history, racial animosity was frequently used to divide labor, leading immigrant
      groups to undercut one another to the industrialist's advantage. Racial provocations
      would also be used as a straw man for industrialists to argue against anti-monopoly
      legislation, shape narratives around land development and act opportunistically
      during times of war.

    content: Why does this matter? Why air out frequently offensive material from
      over 100 years ago? Just as the categorization of <em>Lesbian</em> and <em>Gay</em>
      topics under <em>Abnormal Psychology, Perversion and Derangement</em> in the
      Dewey Decimal System quietly stigmatized generations, I feel that this language
      may still influence our perceptions of ourselves and other communities, long
      past it's original intended use.

    headline: ''

    content: The staying power of this language also has to do with the significance
      of this time period in the Pacific Northwest. The 1880 to 1930 time frame begins
      ten years before the United States Census Bureau declared the closure of the
      western frontier. What follows feels like an ideological land grab instead of
      a physical one. A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>prominent theme
      throughout this research is the concept of "retaining" the American character
      in Washington and Oregon, when it was clearly in a churning state of development.
      A frequent element that appears in the research is gauging different immigrant
      groups on their ability to assimilate or "Americanize."

  content: Because the focus of this project is on how particular groups are being
    described in historic materials, I needed to search for outdated and racist descriptions
    in order to find the materials. Drawing upon the <em>Archives for Black Lives
    in Philadelphia</em>, I chose to use the word <strong>Black</strong> for this
    community, but the searches for this material were drawn from using the search
    term <strong>negro</strong>. This term was the most popular within the search
    parameters that were repeated for each community group (Washington and Oregon
    State publications, 1880-1930), with 340 results from the NewsBank resource, as
    opposed to "colored labor" (165) and "black labor" (55).

      for Native Americans during this period. That said, this description does assume

      a crucial element to how media often 'othered' these communities in order to
      engage in myth making around who a true American was and what they resembled.</span>
