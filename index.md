  headline: "<strong>Introduction</strong>"
  content: This Capstone will collect, analyze and map historical language in newspapers,
    periodicals, legacy oral history recordings and archival collections describing
    immigrant communities in Washington and Oregon and visualize these trends in language
    and how they may have been influenced by specific commercial interests in the
    nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

    slug: p1
    content: The intention of this work is to bring both the industrial interests
      that influenced media representation and the lived experience of the communities
      affected by that language down to a human scale. During this period in American
      history, racial animosity was frequently used to divide labor, leading immigrant
      groups to undercut one another to the industrialist's advantage. Racial provocations
      would also be used as a straw man for industrialists to argue against anti-monopoly
      legislation, shape narratives around land development and act opportunistically
      during times of war.

    headline: Purpose
    slug: p2
    content: Why does this matter? Why air out frequently offensive material from
      over 100 years ago? Just as the categorization of <em>Lesbian</em> and <em>Gay</em>
      topics under <em>Abnormal Psychology, Perversion and Derangement</em> in the
      Dewey Decimal System quietly stigmatized generations, I feel that this language
      may still influence our perceptions of ourselves and other communities, long
      past it's original intended use.
  col_3:
    headline: ''
    slug: p3
    content: The staying power of this language also has to do with the significance
      of this time period in the Pacific Northwest. The 1880 to 1930 time frame begins
      ten years before the United States Census Bureau declared the closure of the
      western frontier. What follows feels like an ideological land grab instead of
      a physical one. A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>prominent theme
      throughout this research is the concept of "retaining" the American character
      in Washington and Oregon, when it was clearly in a churning state of development.
      A frequent element that appears in the research is gauging different immigrant
      groups on their ability to assimilate or "Americanize."

  content: Because the focus of this project is on how particular groups are being
    described in historic materials, I needed to search for outdated and racist descriptions
    in order to find the materials. Drawing upon the <em>Archives for Black Lives
    in Philadelphia</em>, I chose to use the word <strong>Black</strong> for this
    community, but the searches for this material were drawn from using the search
    term <strong>negro</strong>. This term was the most popular within the search
    parameters that were repeated for each community group (Washington and Oregon
    State publications, 1880-1930), with 340 results from the NewsBank resource, as
    opposed to "colored labor" (165) and "black labor" (55).

  headline: "<strong>How to Use this Guide</strong>"
  slug: ht1
  content: This work is centered around the historical network visualization of the
    materials which contains historic newspapers, periodicals, archival collections
    and oral histories relating to 14 community groups from 1880-1930. The visualization
    allows the user to form connections based on community groups, industry or geolocation
    and hopefully act as a springboard to future research. Each element within the
    visualization contains links to the digital object, which can be analyzed in greater
    detail or listened to in full, in the case of the oral history recordings.

  headline: "<strong>Methodology</strong>"
  content: The 14 communities that I focused on for this project were selected using
    two resources. The first was the 13th Federal Census of 1910. I chose this document
    because it is conveniently centered in this project's time span and it is one
    of the first documents to include ethnicity in the population numbers for Washington
    and Oregon state. Of course, these numbers need to be read with extreme skepticism,
    but they do provide us with an insight into the diversity of the Pacific Northwest
    at that point.

  content: The second resource that informed my focus is the Northwest Room, the archive
    of the Tacoma Public Library. Anna Trammell, the Lead Historian for the Northwest
    Room and also the sponsor of this Capstone, curated archival collections and oral
    history recordings which applied to my area of focus and needed organization,
    finding aids and digitization. These projects helped me learn about the Norwegian
    American community through the Ancient Order of Vikings, a fraternal organization
    for immigrants, and the Puyallup Valley chapter of the Japanese American Citizens
    League, a nationwide organization which played a crucial role in WWII incarceration.
    I also pulled from the Northwest Room's <em>Bicentennial Oral History Project</em>,
    where digitized recordings shed light on Puget Sound's Polish, Italian and Native
    American communities.

    content: This involved retrieving the top <strong>40 items</strong> of each group
      based on relevance, or the greatest number of matches for each search term.
      The searches all followed the same formula, <strong>"_____ labor,"</strong>
      <strong>1880-1930</strong> date range, and <strong>Washington</strong> or <strong>Oregon</strong>
      state based publications. From these forty items, I filtered results down to
      <strong>10 items</strong> based on their locality. Items that were reprints
      of stories outside of Washington and Oregon were removed. Items generally focused
      on events in the states, but I felt that editorials on some national topics
      could be included if they provided insight into Pacific Northwest culture.

      are what are used to create the text mining visualizations you'll find throughout
      this exhibit. This method is still developing and being improved upon. This
      data and the overall project serves as a proof of concept towards future iterations
      of work.
